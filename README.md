## Execution-Aware-Hierarchical-Code-Generation-with-Qwen-72B-and-Retrieval-Augmentation

## Abstract

Automatic code generation across multiple programming languages and task complexities is difficult because large language models often fail to keep semantic fidelity, execution consistency, and structural robustness. This work presents CodeForge-Quantum, a hierarchical framework based on Qwen-72B that unifies semantic understanding, syntactic reasoning, and execution-aware generation. The framework uses retrieval-augmented generation to give external context, chain-of-thought prompting to improve reasoning, and adaptive parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce training cost while keeping effectiveness. It also uses hierarchical generation granularity, multi-objective optimization, execution-feedback-guided learning, and cross-language semantic modeling to reach stable and general performance. Compared with earlier methods, CodeForge-Quantum goes beyond single-stage or purely parametric approaches by giving a more controllable, reliable, and extensible solution for multilingual code generation.
